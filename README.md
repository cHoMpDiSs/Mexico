# Mexico
Mexico Dice Game:
I wanted to create a dice game that I have not seen yet in python. Iâ€™m sure it exists, however I wanted to try to build the entire game from the ground up myself. I wanted to showcase my abilities as a programmer to work with classes, create functions, iterate through dictionaries, build my own algorithms and problem solve. I think this project encompasses a lot of what I have learned as a programmer. I am happy with the outcome and intend on making additions in the future. I hope you enjoy.....
